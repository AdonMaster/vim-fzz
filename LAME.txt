gg = first line
G = last line
gG = go to the end of file

gu = makes text lower case.. ex.: guw = alter the current word
guu = makes the line lowercase
gU = upper case
g~ = toggle case of each word... ex.: g~w

ge = moves to the end of prior word

== smart ident
o = new line below AND INSERT MODE
fa = find the next a
; = next find
, = prior find

0 = start of line
$ = end of line

shift + M = center of the page
zz = make ur current cursor be the center of the page

d [something] = puts in delete mode, you can type w, W, 0, $, f...
dd = deletes line

c [something] = puts in change mode


y [something] = puts in yank mode, you can type....
yy = yank line

p = paste after caret
P = paste before caret

r = replace a single character.. but 5r0 = 00000
shift + R = puts in replace mode

s = replace a single character, AND puts you in insert mode
S = removes the line, AND puts you in insert mode



u = undo
ctrl + R = redo


% = navigate between close scopes

diw = delete in word
dip = delete in paragraph
di{ = delete in {
di( = delete in (
^ this works with yank too.. and maybe others


daw = delete around the word (it gobbles spaces with the word)
ex.: "(ab )" => di( => "()"
ex.: "(ab )" => da( => ""


o = new line


:set nu = shows the absolute for current line
:set rnu = shows the relative number for all lines
:set nornu = shows the absolute for all lines (default)


/pomba = search "pomba", n = next, N = prior
? = search but inverted order on n and N


H = HIGH moves to top of visible screen
L = LOW moves to bottom of visible screen
M = MIDDLE of visible screen

J = joins the current line with below it (strip spaces)
gJ = joins the current line with below it (just join)


ZZ = :wq
ZQ = :q!

^ = start of non-blank line


================
a = append, A = append end of line
i = insert, I = insert start of line


====

vib = ()
viB = {}
vi[ = []

==
cursor back on prior position: ''

== MULTIPLE CURSOR
ctrl + v, select a vertical range..
CAPITAL I = edit some text
escapes...
TA DAHH

=== last highlighted selection
gv

=== MULTIPLE CURSOR + end of line edit (only works to add text)
ctrl + v, select a vertical range
I = prepend text
[esc]
gv = restore selection
$ = end of line
A = append to lingee & write text
[esc]

== SUBSTITUTE
- select a range
:'<,'>s/"/'/g (substitute " for ' globally)
-- If you wanna the whole file
:%s/a/b/g (substitute a for b globally)
-- confirm mode
:%s/a/b/gc (substitute a for b globally ON CONFIRMATION)
-- single line 
:s/.....

== MACRO
qa = start recording a macro into [a] register
q = stop macro
@a = play macro
@@ = play last macro


== more navigation + -
+ start of next line, non-blank
- start of previous line, non-blank

== yank + clipboard
copy: "+yw
paste: "+p (doesnt seem to work on windows)

== page navigation
Ctrl + d = half page
ctrl + f = full page
ctrl + b = back page


== bookmark
md = bookmark position to letter d
'd = restore position

== goto line
:30 = goto line 30
19G = goto line 19


=== tricks
10o (puts in edit mode, whatever you write will repeat 10 times)
10i (puts in edit mode, whatever you write will repeat 10 times)


== Using * and # for Quick Searches
* is for finding exact, whole-word matches.
g* is for finding partial, substring matches.


=== JUMP
'' last position
ctrl + o = next
ctrl + i = prior

== INCREMENT & DECREMENT
Ctrl + a
ctrl + x

== PASTE REGISTER
in EDIT MODE = Ctrl + r

== PASTE REGISTER
in NORMAL MODE = 
"%p


== NORM
:norm 
then you execute any command per line


== substitute
:s (current line)
:%s (whole file)
:<..>s (range)


== ! execution!
!<...>sort | uniq



==================================
Ctrl-h	Backspace (delete left)
Ctrl-w	Delete one word backwards
Ctrl-u	Delete from cursor to start of line
Ctrl-o	Do one Normal-mode command, then return to Insert
